# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to assist Maria in the analysisof the new student dataset that includes an additional column that includes the budget of each school. One discovery I made from the findings in our analysis is that Montgomery High School has the largest amount of students. Another thing I found out was that the average math score was 64.68%. The last discover that I will mention is that Matthew Thomas from Dixon High School had the lowest reading score of 10.5.  Perhaps an additional analysis that might be worth while is comparing overall scores with each school's budget.
